      <h2>Ligatures</h2>
                      Ligatures
                      This section includes examples of commonly seen ligatures (combinations of two or
                          more letters) in the main Iliadic text of the Venetus A.
                  
      <h2>Ligatures starting with epsilon</h2>
                      Ligatures starting with epsilon
                      Some of the most common, and initially most troubling, ligatures
                      are the frequent combinations with epsilon:
