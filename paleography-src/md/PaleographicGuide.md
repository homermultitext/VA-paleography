## Ligatures ##

### Symbols ###

Many words are abbreviated with symbols from which we can distinguish few or no letters.

|γάρ|!{γάρ}[73]|
|δέ|!{δέ}[74]|
|ἔστι|!{ἔστι}[75]|
|καί|!{καί}[76]|
|ὅτι|!{ὅτι}[77]|

### Common Words ###

Many words that were common in Byzantine liturgical texts are abbreviated. Usually you have the beginning and end of the word, with the middle letters omitted. Unlike the morphological endings, the abbreviation mark does not always indicate the same string of letters from word to word, so they are tagged as abbreviation in the mark up. Here are some of the common words you will find abbreviated in the Venetus A.

|ἄνθρωπος|!{ἄνθρωπος}[78]|
|υἱός|!{υἱός}[79]|
|γράφει|!{γράφει}[80]|
|εἶναι|!{εἶναι}[81]|
|ἠέλιος|!{ἠέλιος}[82]|
|θεός|!{θεός}[83]|
|λέγει|!{λέγει}[84]|
|λόγος|!{λόγος}[85]|
|μήτηρ|!{μήτηρ}[86]|
|πατήρ|!{πατήρ}[87]|

|φησι|!{φησι}[89]|
|χρόνος|!{χρόνος}[90]|
                        

### Common Prepositions ###
